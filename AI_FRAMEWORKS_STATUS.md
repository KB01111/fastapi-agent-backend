# 🎯 AI Agent Backend - Core Framework Status

## 📊 **CLEANED UP: Only Core AI Frameworks** ✅

Your FastAPI AI Agent Backend has been streamlined to focus on the **3 core AI frameworks** as requested!

### ✅ **Core AI Frameworks** (3/3 Working)

| Framework | Version | Status | Description |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **PraisonAI** | Latest | ✅ Working | Multi-agent orchestration with structured output |
| **CrewAI** | 0.130.0 | ✅ Working | Multi-agent crews for collaborative tasks |
| **AG2/AutoGen** | 0.9.0 | ✅ Working | Conversational multi-agent system |

### 🗑️ **Removed Components**

- ❌ **OpenAI Direct Agent** - Removed (focused on frameworks)
- ❌ **Anthropic Direct Agent** - Removed (focused on frameworks) 
- ❌ **Mock Agent** - Removed (not needed for production)
- ❌ **Pyrefly** - Was incorrectly listed (it's a type checker, not AI framework)

### 🚀 **What's Available Now**

```python
# Clean agent types available
available_agents = [
    "praisonai",  # Multi-agent orchestration
    "crewai",     # Collaborative agent crews  
    "ag2"         # AutoGen conversation agents
]
```

### 🔧 **API Endpoints Updated**

**POST `/v1/answer`** - Now supports only core frameworks:
```json
{
  "task": "Analyze market trends and create a report",
  "agent_type": "praisonai",  // or "crewai" or "ag2"
  "session_id": "optional-session-id",
  "context": {"industry": "technology"}
}
```

**Available Agent Types:**
- `praisonai` - Best for complex multi-step analysis
- `crewai` - Best for collaborative task execution
- `ag2` - Best for conversational problem solving

### 📈 **Performance Benefits**

✅ **Faster Startup**: Removed unused dependencies  
✅ **Cleaner Code**: No legacy mappings or fallbacks  
✅ **Focused Features**: Each framework serves specific use cases  
✅ **Easier Maintenance**: Only 3 core systems to manage  

### 🧪 **Testing Status**

All tests updated for the 3 core frameworks:
- ✅ PraisonAI integration tests
- ✅ CrewAI integration tests  
- ✅ AG2/AutoGen integration tests
- ✅ Load testing with 3 agent types
- ✅ API endpoint validation

### 🔄 **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy the cleaned backend** - Ready for production
2. **Update frontend clients** - Remove references to old agents
3. **Monitor performance** - Track the 3 core frameworks
4. **Optimize configurations** - Fine-tune each framework
